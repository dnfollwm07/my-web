### **Backend Development**

- **Node.js, Koa, Express:**
  Node.js allows us to run JavaScript on the server, useful for handling multiple requests at once. Express and Koa are frameworks for building web servers. Express is popular for its simplicity, while Koa provides a more modern structure with async/await, which makes the code cleaner and more readable.
- **C, C++:**
  C and C++ are powerful programming languages used for building high-performance applications. C is known for being close to the hardware, making it fast but complex. C++ adds features for organizing code, which is helpful for larger projects needing both speed and structure.
