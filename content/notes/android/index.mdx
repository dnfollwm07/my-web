### **Android Development**

- **Java and Android Components (Activity, Service, BroadcastReceiver, ContentProvider, Fragment):**
  Java is the main language for Android apps. Android components include **Activities (for screens)**, **Services (for background tasks)**, **BroadcastReceivers (for receiving system messages)**, **ContentProviders (for data sharing)**, and **Fragments (for reusable UI parts)**. These components work together to create responsive and interactive mobile apps.
  - **Android lifecycle** 
    - **onCreate()**
      Called when the Activity is first created; used for initializing components like layout and data.
    - **onStart()**
      Called when the Activity becomes visible but not yet in the foreground.
    - **onResume()**
      Called when the Activity is in the foreground and ready for user interaction; typically used for animations or refreshing UI.
    - **onPause()**
      Called when the Activity is about to leave the foreground; good for saving temporary data or stopping animations.
    - **onStop()**
      Called when the Activity is no longer visible; release resources not needed when off-screen.
    - **onDestroy()**
      Called before the Activity is destroyed, either from user action or system memory constraints; used for final cleanup.
    - **onRestart()**
      Called when restarting a stopped Activity; often used to re-initialize resources.
- **Native Bridges, OkHttp, Retrofit:**
  Native bridges let JavaScript work with native Android code, so apps can access hardware or system features. OkHttp is a tool for handling HTTP requests, and Retrofit, built on OkHttp, simplifies connecting to web APIs and managing data.
- **RxJava, MVVM, MVP Patterns:**
  RxJava helps manage data as streams, making it easier to handle complex tasks like loading and refreshing data. MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) and MVP (Model-View-Presenter) are ways of organizing code to keep the UI and logic separate, making apps easier to maintain.
