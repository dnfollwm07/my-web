### **Frontend Development**

- **React Native (Redux, Redux-saga, Unidirectional Data Flow, Performance Optimization):**
  React Native lets us build mobile apps for iOS and Android using JavaScript. Redux helps keep app data organized by controlling data in one direction, which makes it predictable and easier to debug. Redux-saga manages things like fetching data, making it more reliable. Performance optimization in React Native often involves techniques like loading images and data only when needed, so the app runs faster.
- **HTML5, CSS, Flexbox:**
  HTML5 is the core of every webpage, giving structure to the content. CSS controls the visual look, like colors and layout. Flexbox is a CSS tool that makes creating responsive, flexible layouts easier, which is essential for modern web design.
- **JavaScript, TypeScript, ES6:**
  JavaScript is a popular language for making websites interactive. ES6 is a version that adds helpful features like easier syntax for functions and better ways to organize code. TypeScript adds type-checking to JavaScript, helping us catch errors early, especially useful in larger projects.
- **Vue.js (2.0/3.0), Vuex, Vue-router, ElementUI:**
  Vue.js is a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces, making it easy to create dynamic and reusable components. Vuex manages app data centrally, so we can control all parts of the app in one place. Vue-router allows smooth page navigation, and ElementUI provides ready-made, user-friendly components for faster development.
- **XML:**
  XML is a markup language for storing and sharing data in a structured way. Itâ€™s widely used for data exchange between different systems.
