After graduation, I worked as a full-time front-end developer at Meituan in Beijing, China, for two years. There, I was part of the transportation front-end team, where my main responsibilities included maintaining the airline ticket purchase channels on the Meituan and Dianping apps, as well as in WeChat mini-programs, which are accessible to millions of daily users. Additionally, I managed the configuration system for airline ticket suppliers.

This high-traffic environment required me to be consistently aware of online security and design comprehensively for optimal user experience. Our primary tech stack included React Native, Vue.js, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML5, and CSS. Beyond fulfilling development requirements, we emphasized code simplicity, readability, and reusability. Over two years, I developed over 20 reusable business components, such as buttons, tab navigation bars, and display cards, which reduced workload across the team. Additionally, we implemented an efficient development model by incorporating a low-code platform for the merchant suppliers, reducing our teamâ€™s workload.

When it comes to user-facing applications, I prioritize optimizing first content paint time. In addition to strategies like reducing bundle size and preloading requests, I optimized monitoring by utilizing the company's internal profile API to automate daily alerts and analysis, significantly reducing the maintenance burden on the team.
